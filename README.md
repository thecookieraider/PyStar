# PyStar

Small program that generates an intricate maze using an implementation of a randomized depth-first search algorithm, and then searches the maze from start to finish for the shortest path using A* and highlighting searched areas in red, and when finished, highlights the shortest path in green.

Controls:

r - Reset maze (and points if randomized points is toggled on)
p - Toggle randomized starting and end points
